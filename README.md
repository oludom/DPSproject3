# Deciding the Coordinator in a cluster. 


This repository contains a project, which explores leader election in distributed systems. The project was done for the course Distributed and Pervasive Systems at Aarhus University. The Bully Algorithm was implemented in python and uses Flask for simple network communication and a small ui, showing the state of the network.
